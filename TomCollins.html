    <h1>How to make a Tom Collins</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p> Tom Collins is a gin-based cocktail made with lemon juice, simple syrup, and club soda. It's served over ice in a Tom Collins glass.

        Tom Collins is <b>not</b> named after a real person. Though the recipe <i>likely</i> originated in London, the cocktail's name probably comes from a practical joke that took New York and Philadelphia by storm in the 1870s.
        
        It went like this: Someone would ask their friend, "Do you know Tom Collins?" When the friend said they did not know Tom Collins, the prankster would say that the nonexistent man was going from bar to bar telling lies about him.
        
        The joke was so widespread it was dubbed The Great Tom Collins Hoax of 1874.
